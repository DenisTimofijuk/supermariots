Scenario:
----------------------------------------------------------

"Since this challange is not only for the programmers, my task was to make it suitable for all level users.
Also I tried to keep the things closely to our dailly life in sermo, so I came up with this idea. I created a simple game ' Super Sermonian' it is based on a well known game 'Super Mario'.
Running timer represents time pressure in our dayly life dealig with the task as well as it requires attention to the details toogether with keeping attention to the main goal."
Since there are peoples with some advantiges in PC gaming, this challange consists from 2 different parts: first one is simple pasick PC game, but the second one is requiring to have a lot of attention to little details and sharp mind to find out what second move should be. So those with fast reflexes will not gain any advantage against those with slow reflexes. They all will have to pause and think how to beat this quest.
